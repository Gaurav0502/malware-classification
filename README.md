# Malware Byteplot Images Classifications

## Problem Statement

A comparative analysis of the malware image classification based the class imbalance. The datasets used for the analysis include the Malimg dataset, Malevis dataset, and a Blended dataset. The blended dataset is created by using all 25 malware classes(except the "Other" class) from the Malevis dataset and 5 classes from the Malimg dataset. The models used for comparison chiefly includes the state of the art CNNs trained on the datasets using Transfer Learning. Here, Malimg dataset is considered as the highly imbalanced dataset, blended dataset is considered as an intermediate imbalance dataset, and  the Malevis dataset is the prefectly balanced dataset. 

## Methodology

The three datasets are characterized by different kinds of images in terms of the number of channels. The Malimg dataset has all grayscale images while on the other hand the Malevis dataset has RGB images. Consequently, the blended dataset comprises both RGB and grayscale images. However, for modelling the number of channels is uniformly defined as 3 (i.e. using all RGB images). The grayscale images are converted to RGB format by repeating the grayscale channel thrice. The images are resized to 75 by 75.

Now, six state of the art CNNs are trained on each of the datasets and evaluated to compare their performance based change in the imbalance of the datasets. The comparative analysis is carried out as dataset-wise and model-wise. In model-wise comparision, the performance of the models is compared indivdually across each dataset followed by a dataset-wise comparision, the performance is evaluated across all models together.
