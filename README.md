# Malware Byteplot Images Classifications

## About Dataset Used

Malimg is an open source dataset for malware classification using malware byte plot images. The dataset contains 9,339 byteplot images of malware across 25 families. Byteplot images are grayscale images which are derived from the binary files of malware files. A grayscale image is one which has only one channel where every entry in the pixel matrix element has a one or zero corresponding to their respective bits in the binary file. The dataset is available in Kaggle<sup>[1]</sup> and was first introduced experimented in this paper<sup>[2]</sup>.
