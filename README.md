# Malware Byteplot Image Classification

## Aim

A comparison of variation in model convergence and performance with change in class imbalance. To assess the variation three datasets are created with varying imbalance in class distribution namely Malimg dataset, Malevis dataset, and Blended dataset. For comparison, the state-of-the-art CNNs from Keras library are explored namely: InceptionNet, ResNet50, DenseNet169, EfficientNetB4, InceptionResNetV2, and VGG16 

## Datasets

- The Malimg dataset is available <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manaswinisunkari/malimg-dataset9010">here</a>.
- The Malevis dataset is available <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sohamkumar1703/malevis-dataset">here</a> and its website is <a href="https://web.cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/~selman/malevis/">here</a>.
- The Blended Malware dataset is available <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravpendharkar/blended-malware-image-dataset/settings">here</a>.

## Kaggle Notebooks
The tasks of Malware Classification and a minor fix to it were carried out in Kaggle using GPU P100. The codes can be found in the respective notebooks:
